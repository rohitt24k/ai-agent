### Agent Interaction

#### `POST /agent/message`

This is the primary endpoint for communicating with the AI agent. It processes a user's message, leveraging RAG and a plugin system to generate a response.

- **Description**: Sends a message to the AI agent within a specific session. The agent's response is based on the LLM, historical chat messages, retrieved context, and potential plugin results.
- **Input (JSON Body)**:
  ```json
  {
    "message": "What is the weather in London?",
    "session_id": "user-session-123"
  }
  ```
- **Output (JSON)**:
  ```json
  {
    "content": {
      "response": "The current weather in London is 15Â°C with partly cloudy skies."
    }
  }
  ```
- **Note**: The output from the LLM is a JSON object. If a tool call is required, the output will contain a `tool_calls` array instead of a `response` string.
